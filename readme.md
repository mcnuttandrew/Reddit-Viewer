This is the reddit viewer, it is in development and needs some real work in a few places.
The current desired additional set of major ish features is:

- Zoom (so that the comments dont have to bend inward to stay on the page)
- Visual Overhaul
- Load in visual overhaul, and maybe have top thread by a fill in for whatever subreddit 
- Children stuff
