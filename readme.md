This is the reddit viewer, it is in development and needs some real work in a few places.
The current desired additional set of major ish features is:

- Data binding on comments
- Zoom (so that the comments dont have to bend inward to stay on the page)
- Visual Overhaul
- Drag and drop?
- Branch sway?
- Reddit thread suggester
- Click pic pulls pic over visualization ala that one a/A pluggin assignment
- get a god damn templating system
